    I totally understand where you're coming from. But let's break it down a bit. For such a low price, you're getting a whole lot of protection and services! 📉

    Think about it – if you ever need an electrician, plumber, or even a locksmith, you'd typically pay at least R$ 150 per visit. With our insurance, not only do you get coverage for big things like fire, theft, and natural disasters, but you also get those handy services up to 2 times a year included! 🛠️🔧

    So, in the long run, you're actually saving money and getting peace of mind. It's like having a safety net for your home and wallet! 💰🏡

    Isn't that a great deal? 😊

    I get it, it might seem like a lot initially. But let's think about it this way: unexpected things happen, and having a safety net can make a huge difference. 🔍

    Imagine if there was a fire, or a break-in, or even just a major electrical issue. These things can cost thousands to fix. With our policy, you're covered for thousands of $. That's a lot of peace of mind for such a low price! 🔥🔌

    Plus, the added services like plumbing, electrical work, and even changing light bulbs are super handy. You never know when you'll need them, and having them included means you won't have to scramble to find a reliable professional or pay high fees. 🛠️💡

    It's all about being prepared and protecting your home and your finances. For reasonable cost, you're getting comprehensive coverage and services. That’s pretty valuable, don’t you think? 😊

I'm safe:

    It's easy to think that nothing bad will happen, but life can be unpredictable. For such a low price, you get peace of mind knowing you're covered in case of fire, theft, or even natural disasters like hurricanes and tornadoes. Plus, you get handy services like an electrician or plumber included! 🛠️ Imagine needing an emergency repair and not having to worry about the cost. Better safe than sorry, right? 😉

Other priorities:

    I hear you! Balancing finances can be tough. But think of it this way: you're not only protecting your home and belongings but also getting access to essential services like plumbers and electricians. 🛠️ 

    If something unexpected happens, it could end up costing you a lot more than that. It's like a small investment for big peace of mind. Plus, it's one less thing to worry about in your busy life! 😊
